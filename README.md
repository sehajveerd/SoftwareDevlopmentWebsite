What poppin


Yea so basically open up vs code

File

New Window, or maybe you already at new window

Clone Git Repository

Clone From GitHub

Then click on the repo name should be the SoftwareDevlopmentWebsite

Now choose where to store the file on PC

Now the repo shouldve opened, if not then oopsi daisy call me

Now to run make sure you have the Live Server extension installed.

At the bottom it should say Go Live, click on that and it should open on your browser

If you dont have it then you can just go to the folder and right click and then go to open with then click on chrome or whatever.

If you don't use chrome kinda gay but yea



Anyways


So yea development server is running as in you seeing the website yay. 



Now when you change the code it only changes on your local copy of the repo, so if you change it I won't have the changes unless you do the following. 

So open up the terminal, well first make sure everything runs right ykwim, anywas so open up terminal

Now type in "Git add ."

Now "Git commit -m "blah blah""

where is says blah blah you write a comment of the changes you did. and obv dont tyype the quotes sournding the messege. 

Now "Git pull" 

Always pull before push

Always update your own code with code from repo then push your own code

So now make sure everything is like merged and works good,

now do "Git push" and wow you updated the repo and your all good.
