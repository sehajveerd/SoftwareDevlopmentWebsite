# SoftwareDevlopmentWebsite

What poppin


Yeah so basically open up vs code

"File"

"New Window", or maybe you are already at a new window

"Clone Git Repository"

"Clone From GitHub"

Then click on the repo name should be the "SoftwareDevlopmentWebsite"

Now choose where to store the file on PC

Now the repo should have opened, if not then oopsi daisy call me

Now try to run and make sure you have the "Live Server extension installed".

At the bottom it should say "Go Live", click on that and it should open on your browser

If you don't have it then you can just go to the folder and right click and then go to open with then click on Chrome or whatever.

If you don't use Chrome kinda gay but yea



Anyways


So yea development server is running as in you seeing the website yay. 



Now when you change the code it only changes on your local copy of the repo, so if you change it I won't have the changes unless you do the following. 

So open up the terminal, well first make sure everything runs right ykwim, anyways so open up terminal

Now type in "Git add ."

Now "Git commit -m "blah blah""

where it says blah blah you write a comment on the changes you did. and obv don't type the quotes surrounding the message. 

Now "Git pull" 

Always pull before push

Always update your code with code from the repo then push your code

So now make sure everything is like merged and works good,

now do "Git push" and wow you updated the repo and your all good.
