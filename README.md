"File"

"New Window", or maybe you are already at a new window

"Clone Git Repository"

"Clone From GitHub"

Then click on the repo name should be the "SoftwareDevlopmentWebsite"

Now choose where to store the file on PC

Now the repo should have opened

Now try to run and make sure you have the "Live Server extension installed".

At the bottom it should say "Go Live", click on that and it should open on your browser

If you don't have it then you can just go to the folder and right click and then go to open with then click on Chrome.

Now when you change the code it only changes on your local copy of the repo, so if you change it I won't have the changes unless you do the following. 

So open up the terminal,

Now type in "Git add ."

Now "Git commit -m "Write a comment""

Now "Git pull" 

Always pull before push

Always update your code with code from the repo then push your code

So now make sure everything is like merged and works good,

now do "Git push" and your all good.
